Example project for Disney

I could keep tweaking this forever, but I think right about the time I started thinking about a custom focus bitmap is a good place to start. 

Notice that I added a default bitmap for the posters because the second image on the first row doesn't load from the url. Thanks for your time. 

Also, in case you're not using vscode, or using my launch file, you'll need to make sure the /img folder is included in the build.
